Supervised machine learning
- when we have inputs and targets (X and Y)
- we aim to train (X, Y) and predict (X)
- classification
	- labels are discrete (up or down, left or right)
	- will the value go up or down
- regression
	- trying to predict real numbers
	- trying to predict a value

Unsupervised machine learning
- we are only given X
- try to learn the structure of the X data

Conventions in ML
- X is a matrix of shape NxD
- N is the number of samples
- D is the number of features
- Y is a vector of shape Nx1
